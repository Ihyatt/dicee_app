Dart and Flutter Compillation 
- Code is parsed from top to bottom
- translated to other ios and android code

Categories of words
- Keyowrds:
  - Built into the programming language
  - have clear specific meanings

 - Identifiers
   - Defined by developers
   - Used for identifying "things" in code
  
  How flutter becomes active 
  - main() function gets executed automsticslly
  - runApp() should be called inside main()
  - Pass the to-be-displayed "widget tree" to runApp()

Flutter UIs are built with widgets
- Widgets are nested into each other
- ex. Center(child: Text('Hello world)));
  - widget tree
